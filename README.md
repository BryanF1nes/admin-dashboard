# Admin Dashboard #
This project is the final project in "The Odin Projects" - Intermediate HTML and CSS section.
A lot of techniques were learned in this module, such as utilizing "Grid". I went ahead on a slightly different approach on the design of this dashboard by using a color palette found on Adobe color palletes.

This project utilizes basic HTML and CSS styles. All CSS is custom styling, the HTML structure was planned ahead of time with a piece of paper to help visualize how I wanted to block different segments out.
Overall I had a fun time being able to utilize a custom color palette and doing some little animations on hover. I look foward to coming back to this project and re-doing a lot especially now that i'm learning more advanced JavaScript techniques and learning the React framework.

* I tried hosting this application on GitHub pages however I was having some issues with the SVG and images not properly loading so I went ahead and used Netlify instead. Thanks!
